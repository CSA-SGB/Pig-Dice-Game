'''Pig (Version  1.0)

Instructions:
Each player repeatedly rolls a die until a 1 is rolled or the player holds.

If the player rolls a 1, the player's turn total is set back to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.

If the player rolls any number other than 1 it is added to their turn total.

If a player chooses to 'hold', their turn total is added to their score.

First player to score 100 or more points wins.'''
